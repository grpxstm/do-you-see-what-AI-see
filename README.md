### Glaucoma detection from fundus images
For a detailed introduction into eye diseases, glaucoma, and previous literature, please refer to [this presentation](link-to-presentation-on-GitHub).

#### Project context
This project is part of the Ironhack Data Analytics Remote Part Time bootcamp and was completed in 3 weeks.

#### Project description
In this project, I will be implementing previously used neural network architectures for glaucoma detection from retinal fundus images. The purpose of the project is both to compare previous architectures on new datasets, as well as to learn and understand their usage in each context.

#### Technical requirements
Please refer to the `requirements.txt`.

#### ML process summary
The project was separated in multiple Jupyter notebooks explaining each specific part of the project, which you can find below:

1. [Data Collection & Exploration]()
2. [Image Augmentation]()
...
x. [Learning Resources]()

#### Project Challenges 

#### Lessons Learned
1. Collect data early - it takes a while for images to download
