## Learning Resources

I found the following material useful for completing this project - in this order of study:

1. [Machine Learning by Stanford University](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-course/home/info)(weeks 1-5) - Useful for understanding loss functions, optimization methods, and the basic principles of how neural networks function
*Note:* This has now been replaced by []()

2. [Introduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-computer-vision-watson-opencv/home/info)(weeks 1-2) - Useful for understanding basic image structure & manipulation

3. [Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow?specialization=tensorflow-in-practice) - Great introduction to using tensorflow to set up deep neural networks (DNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs)

4. [Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow/home/info)

5. [Implementing GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning in Keras](https://machinelearningmastery.com/grid-search-hyperparameters-deep-learning-models-python-keras/)
